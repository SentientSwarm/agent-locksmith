# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Internal

- Box the internal HTTP admission error response for current-stable Clippy;
  the handler returns the original response with unchanged admission behavior.

- Use a guarded match for inherited OAuth default-session selection to satisfy
  current-stable Clippy. Existing explicit labels and non-OAuth sources retain
  their behavior.

### Added

- Finite reviewed HTTP grants pair named agents with explicitly selected accounts,
  with runnable reference and independent customer-service setup instructions.
- Operator reads distinguish active, pending and disabled connections. Saved
  writes that fail activation report that failure while affected routes deny
  admission and unrelated healthy routes remain available.

### Breaking changes

- Credentialed requests require an explicitly selected account for each allowed
  agent. Missing bindings deny access; unavailable selected credentials fail
  closed. Locksmith no longer falls back to a registration default, another
  OAuth session, or an unauthenticated upstream.
- Credentialed legacy routes require a registered agent identity. Clearing a
  binding removes access instead of restoring a default account. Direct
  file-backed bindings require an explicit sealed-snapshot import.

- New agents and bootstrap policies have no implicit HTTP grants. Existing
  policies require finite review, including authless connections; adding a
  registration never expands authority. Unsupported narrower selectors are refused.
- Deleting/recreating a route or changing its upstream/egress clears its grants
  and selections. Deliberate destination review and reapproval are required.

### Upgrade and verification

- Back up a consistent database, preview and review the reference-only mapping,
  apply the selected bindings, then verify the cutover and restart. Existing
  explicit selections are preserved; ambiguous mappings need operator input.
  Follow [the migration guide](docs/user/concepts/migrating-account-bindings.md).
- [The repeatable daemon/CLI smoke](docs/development/explicit-account-bindings-smoke.md)
  covers account attribution, zero-dispatch denials, migration and the documented
  setup commands using synthetic accounts. It does not establish live provider
  compatibility, installed-deployment acceptance, a version tag or publication.
- The binding-repair change guide distinguishes accepted D1 work from remote
  integration and release status.

- For the HTTP grant cutover, stop writers and take a compatible binary/schema/
  configuration/state backup. Use the reviewed `preview --grants` workflow to
  commit finite policy and account references atomically. Old unreviewed bootstrap
  tokens need re-minting; stale plans must not resurrect removed authority.
- See [HTTP grant and activation changes](docs/user/changes/explicit-http-grants.md)
  for saved-but-failed activation repair, next-admission boundaries and limits.
  Original local synthetic acceptance is historical; this projected candidate
  still needs its own receiving checks, remote review and CI. No version/tag or
  live-provider compatibility is claimed.
